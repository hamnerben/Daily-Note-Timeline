# Roadmap
1. Main goal:  **Get it to display** we don't need clickable that will be something we can add
2. Clicking a cell opens a note from that week.
3. Simple interface to navigate between notes in a week. 
- Perhaps a simple 7 day calendar to the right of the week to show day of the week and Month (I like this idea!)
