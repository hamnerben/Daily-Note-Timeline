# retrospective

1. I started out working on the donut charts when that was too much "in the weeds". Now that I stepped back and just trying to get obisidan to display something in the view, I can see where I need to go next. 

2. There was a long feedback loop in experimenting with the API. I found that I could open the console within the obsidian developer console to test out API features.

3. I keep running into problems and I keep backing up and backing up until I realize I'm not doing `npm run`.  Dangit
